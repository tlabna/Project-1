          <h2>Lesson 1: The Basics of the Web and HTML</h2>
          <div>
            <h3>How the web works</h3>
              <p>
                The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other.
                When a person surfs the <b>The World Wide Web</b> <em>(www)</em>, their computer 
                sends a HTTP request <em>(Hypertext Transfer Protocol)</em> to a server which responds
                with an appropriate html document. Your web browser then interprets the document
                and displays it on the screen.
              </p>
              <div>
                <p>The image below best describes how the web works:</p>

            <h3>HTML</h3>
              <p>
              <b>HTML</b> stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>. HTML documents contain text 
              content which describes "what you see" and markup which describes "how it looks".
              </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>HTML Vocabulary</h3>
              <p>
                <b>Tag</b>: An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. 
                Most tags have an opening tag (< p > for example) and a closing tag, (< /p >) 
                Some tags (called <b>void</b> tags) do not require a closing tag 
                (like the < br > tag).
              </p>  
              <p>
                <b>Element</b>: An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening 
                and closing tags.  
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Attribute</b>: This is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set 
                the <em>href</em> attribute of an anchor tag to the Udacity URL, you would
                write <em>< a href="www.udacity.com" ></em>. Here's the attribute in action: 
                <a href="https://www.udacity.com" target="_blank">Udacity Website</a>
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Inline vs. Block</b>: HTML elements are either inline or block. 
                Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.
              </p>

          <div>
            <h3>The Tree-Like Structure of HTML</h3>
            <p>
              The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. When experts talk about the <b>DOM</b> <em>(Document Object Model)</em>, they are talking about the tree-like structure of an HTML page. In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes.
            </p>
            <div>
              <p>Here's an image of the tree like structure of an html page:</p>

          <div>
            <h3>Developer Tools</h3>
            <p>Browsers come with developer tools where you can inspect elements on webpages. Not all elements are displayed but you can see the whole structure (DOM) of a webpage. You can also play around with styles on webpages and see changes in real-time using these developer tools.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Text Editors</h3>
            <p>Programmers use special text editors to code. These editors make the programmer's life easier. For example, some text editors will automatically generate a closing HTML tag when you write an opening tag. <b>Sublime Text</b> is an example of a great text editor. You can use this editor to code many languages and it will detect the syntax to help you write cleaner code.</p>

          <h2>Lesson 3: Adding CSS Style to HTML Structure</h2>
          <div>
            <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
            <p>
              CSS stands for <em>Cascading Style Sheets</em> and is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of an HTML document written in a markup language. This is done by giving similar HTML elements the same class name and then specifying the style that should apply to that class.
            </p>

            <h3>Avoiding Repetition</h3>
            <p>As a programmer it is very important to avoid repetition. Here are some reasons why:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Avoiding Errors:</b> Rewriting the same code over and over can lead to errors when the programmer decides to make a change to something. 
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Consistency</b> 
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
